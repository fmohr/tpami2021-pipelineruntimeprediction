This repository contains Java code to reproduce the runtimes of the WEKA learners as well as Python code to reproduce the result aggregations and the plots used in the paper.

Note that the *data* collected in the *execution* of the experiments is currently not available for download since files are too big for GitHub. They can currently be *requested* from the authors and will in some soon future be made available for download at some place.
